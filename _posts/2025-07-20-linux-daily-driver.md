# Why I Use Linux Every Day — And Why Open Source Is Getting Better Than Paid Software

For a long time, I used whatever came preinstalled on laptops: Windows for work, a mix of free apps for personal projects. It was fine, until I started really caring about what my computers *do*, and how they *do it*.  

That’s when I switched to Linux as my daily driver — and honestly, I don’t think I’ll go back.

## 🖥️ A Curious Geek on Used Hardware and Linux

My setup isn’t massive, but it’s full of stories: a few used ThinkPads, old monitors I’ve revived, and some keyboards and electronics projects I’ve built myself. Nothing here is shiny and new; each piece is salvaged, repaired, or self-made.  

Running Linux on this gear has been a revelation. Older laptops that might struggle with Windows breeze along with lightweight distros like Arch, Debian, or Fedora. Even my mini PCs, rescued from corporate recycling, run server tasks, media centers, or development environments with ease.  

Using Linux has not only given new life to older hardware but also reinforced a simple truth: **quality and freedom often beat flashy, disposable tech**.

## 🌟 Why Linux Feels Different

### 1. **Control and Customization**
Linux isn’t just an OS; it’s a toolkit. Every part of it can be configured: window managers, desktop environments, system services, even kernel modules.  
Want a tiling window manager like `dwm` or `i3`? Done. Prefer a clean GNOME setup? Easy. Your computer actually *behaves the way you want it to*.  

### 2. **Privacy and Security**
No built-in telemetry, no forced updates that slow down your workflow. You control what runs and when. For someone curious about tech and responsible computing, that’s huge.  

### 3. **Performance**
Older hardware that feels sluggish on Windows often flies on Linux. Lightweight distros, good package management, and optional bloat-free setups let you get the most out of used or recycled machines.  

### 4. **Open Source Is Actually Catching Up — Sometimes Surpassing Paid Software**
Free and open-source tools today often compete with or even outperform commercial alternatives. Examples:

- **LibreOffice** → A full-featured office suite that keeps improving with frequent releases.  
- **Krita** → Professional-grade painting software that rivals Photoshop in features and stability.  
- **Nextcloud** → Self-hosted cloud storage and collaboration, comparable to Google Workspace or Dropbox, with total control.  
- **GIMP & Inkscape** → Powerful image editing and vector graphics tools.  
- **Visual Studio Code (Open Source Build) & JetBrains IDE alternatives** → Excellent development environments that often run faster and with fewer licensing headaches.  

Open source software isn’t just “good enough” anymore — in some cases, it’s better because you can tweak it, integrate it, or run it anywhere, including on older hardware.

## 🔧 Daily Life With Linux

Using Linux daily has reshaped the way I think about computing:

- I experiment with window managers, shells, and dotfiles.  
- I resurrect old hardware instead of tossing it.  
- I replace proprietary services with self-hosted or open-source alternatives, from mail servers to media centers.  
- I even tinker with software and hardware integration, like connecting old monitors and ThinkPads into small personal servers or smart home setups.  

It’s not just about being efficient — it’s about **understanding and controlling your tech**, and learning continuously along the way.

## 🌍 Open Source Meets Sustainability and Responsibility

Linux and open-source software also tie into bigger values:

- **Longevity**: Old laptops can stay useful for years with Linux.  
- **Freedom**: You aren’t locked into ecosystems that force you to upgrade.  
- **Community-driven improvement**: Unlike many paid apps, open-source software evolves through collaboration and transparency.  

Combining Linux with used or repurposed hardware reinforces a philosophy I’ve been building for years: **tech should empower, not consume.** Every device I salvage, every piece of software I control, is a small step away from consumerist waste and toward thoughtful computing.

## ⚡ Final Thoughts

Using Linux as a daily driver isn’t about rejecting other operating systems — it’s about choice. About curiosity. About reclaiming control over your tools and your workflow.  

Paired with used hardware, open-source software becomes more than just a practical choice: it’s a statement. A statement that **quality, freedom, and responsibility matter more than shiny new devices or flashy marketing**.  

For curious geeks like me, it’s deeply satisfying — every laptop rescued, every keyboard built, every Linux tweak applied is proof that technology can be sustainable, empowering, and endlessly fascinating.
