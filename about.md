The word "about" has always intrigued me. It's such a small word, yet it carries so much weight. I remember when I was in elementary school, our teacher asked us to write a short essay about ourselves. As a curious and somewhat mischievous kid, I decided to take a different approach. Instead of writing the usual "My name is Bogdan, and I like..." I wrote a story titled "About the Word 'About'."

In my essay, I explored how the word "about" is used to connect ideas, introduce topics, and give context. It was my little linguistic adventure. My teacher was both amused and impressed, and she shared my essay with the class. It was a proud moment for me, realizing that a simple word like "about" could be the starting point of a story.

This early experience taught me the power of words and the importance of context. It's not just about what we say, but how we say it and what we choose to focus on. So, in this "About" section, I aim to give you a glimpse into my worldâ€”my passions, my journey, and the stories that have shaped me.
